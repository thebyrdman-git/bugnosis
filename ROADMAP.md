# Bugnosis Roadmap

Our path to becoming the "Antivirus for Open Source Bugs".

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Current)
- [x] **Impact Scoring Engine:** 0-100 scoring algorithm based on user impact.
- [x] **Smart Search:** AI-powered resolution of "React" -> `facebook/react`.
- [x] **Multi-Platform:** Support for GitHub, GitLab, and Bugzilla.
- [x] **Hero Dashboard:** XP, Ranks, and "Antivirus" aesthetic UI.
- [ ] **Offline Mode:** Local caching (SQLite) for reviewing bugs without internet.

## Phase 2: The AI Co-Pilot
- [ ] **Diagnosis Engine:** AI explains *why* a bug is happening.
- [ ] **Strategy Architect:** AI proposes 3 fix strategies (Quick, Robust, Refactor).
- [ ] **Code Generation:** AI drafts the fix (User reviews & approves).
- [ ] **PR Generator:** AI writes the PR description (Context, Fix, Impact).
- [ ] **Rejection Coaching:** AI analyzes closed/rejected PRs to help you learn.

## Phase 3: The Ecosystem
- [ ] **Cloud Sync:** Optional Google Sign-In to sync XP and Watch Lists.
- [ ] **Plugin System:** Allow community to write scanners for Jira, Redmine, etc.
- [ ] **Leaderboards:** Global, Friend Leagues, and Personal Best tracking.
- [ ] **Missions:** Personalized goals ("Fix 3 Python Bugs", "Earn 5000 XP").

## Phase 4: Mass Adoption
- [ ] **One-Click Installers:** Windows, Mac, Linux (AppImage/Flatpak).
- [ ] **Browser Extension:** "Scan this repo" button on GitHub/GitLab.
- [ ] **Enterprise Edition:** Self-hosted for internal corporate open source programs.
